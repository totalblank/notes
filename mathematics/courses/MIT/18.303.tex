    \subsection{Description}
    \noindent This course provides students with the basic analytical and computational tools 
    of linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for practical applications in science 
    engineering, including heat/diffusion, wave, and Poisson equations.

    \noindent Analytics emphasize the viewpoint of linear algebra and the analogy with finite matrix
    problems including operator adjoints and eigenproblems, series solutions, Greenâ€™s functions,
    and separation of variables.

    \noindent Numerics focus on finite-difference and finite-element techniques to reduce PDEs to matrix
    problems, including stability and convergence analysis and implicit/explicit time-stepping.

    \noindent Julia programming language is introduced and used in homework for simple examples.
    Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing,
    with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.
    It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy,
    and an extensive mathematical function library.

    \noindent Difference between 18.06 and 18.303 is outlined. As I didn't
    take 18.06, I wouldn't know. 

    \subsection{L 02 - Poisson's equation and eignefunctions in 1D: Fourier sine series}
    \subsubsection{Orthogonality of two functions}
    \noindent Two real functions $ f(x) $ and $ g(x) $ are orthogonal if for any interval 
    $ (a, b) $ in both of their domain, the following is true,
    \begin{equation}
	    \int_{a}^{b} f(x) g(x) \, dx = 0
	    \label{eqn:1}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent The dot product of two functions is defined as,
    \begin{equation}
	f(x) \cdot g(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) g(x) \, dx
    	\label{eq:2}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent If the functions are complex functions, the dot product (or inner product)
    of the two functions are defined as,

    \begin{equation}
	\innerp{f}{g} = \int_{-\infty}^{-\infty} \overline{f(x)} g(x) \, dx
    	\label{eq:3}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent Equations \ref{eq:2} and \ref{eq:3} need not to be from $ -\infty $ to $ \infty $.
    The limit can be any interval that is being considered.
    It can be shown than for two sine function $ sin(n \pi x) $ and 
    $ sin(m \pi x) $, they are orthogonal if $ n \neq m $. They are not orthogonal
    otherwise.

    \subsubsection{Fourier sine series}
    \noindent The Fourier sine series for a function $ f(x) $ defined on
    $ x \in [0,1] $ writes $ f(x) $ as,

    \begin{equation}
	    f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n sin(n \pi x)
    	\label{eq:4}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent $ b_n $ can be computed by multiplying both sides of equation \ref{eq:4}
    by $ sin(m \pi x) $ and then integrating both sides from 0 to 1.

    \begin{equation}
	b_m = 2 \int_{0}^{1} f(x) sin(m \pi x) \, dx
    	\label{eq:5}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent Fourier claimed (without proof) that \emph{any} function
    $ f(x) $ can be expanded in terms of sines in this way, even
    discontinuous functions! That is, these sine functions form an
    \emph{orthogonal basis} for "all" functions! But this turned out to be
    false. Rather Carleson (1966) and Hunt (1968) proved that: any function
    $ f(x) $ where $ \int (\lvert f(x) \rvert)^p \, dx $ is finite for some
    $ p > 1 $ has a Fourier series that converges \emph{almost} everywhere
    to $ f(x) $ (except at isolated points). At points where $ f(x) $ has
    a jump discontinuity, the Fourier series converges to the midpoint of
    the jump. Except for crazy \emph{divergent functions} or the function
    values exactly at points of discontinuity, Fourier's remarkable claim
    is essentially true.

    \noindent for $ f(x) = 1 $,
    \begin{equation}
	b_n = 
    	\begin{cases}
		\frac{4}{n \pi} & \text{n odd} \\
		0 & \text{n even}
    	\end{cases}
    	\label{eq:6}
    \end{equation}

    \pagebreak

    \noindent For triangular function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \lvert x - \frac{1}{2} \rvert $, $ b_{m, \text{odd}} = \frac{4}{(m \pi)^2} (-1)^{\frac{m-1}{2}} $ . And the Fourier sine series of that triangular function is,

    \begin{equation}
	    f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi^2} sin(\pi x) - \frac{4}{(3 \pi)^2} sin(3 \pi x) + \frac{4}{(5 \pi)^2} sin(5 \pi x) + ...
    	\label{eq:7}
    \end{equation}
