    \subsection{Description}
    \noindent This course provides students with the basic analytical and computational tools 
    of linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for practical applications in science 
    engineering, including heat/diffusion, wave, and Poisson equations.

    Analytics emphasize the viewpoint of linear algebra and the analogy with finite matrix
    problems including operator adjoints and eigenproblems, series solutions, Greenâ€™s functions,
    and separation of variables.

    Numerics focus on finite-difference and finite-element techniques to reduce PDEs to matrix
    problems, including stability and convergence analysis and implicit/explicit time-stepping.

    Julia programming language is introduced and used in homework for simple examples.
    Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing,
    with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.
    It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy,
    and an extensive mathematical function library.
