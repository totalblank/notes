\section{July 5, 2024}
\noindent I got admitted to BUET on February 22nd, 2020. It's more than four years now. I don't know
what I did in these four years, I really don't. But I must've done something, I can't really recall.
For as long as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a computer guy. I can't really call myself
a computer guy. I always wanted to be economically stable. I am not economically stable. I always wanted
a fit and strong body. My body is not as fit and strong I wished it to be. I loved one girl and couldn't
make her mine. It's 4:20 AM in the morning and I feel lost. I feel like a failure and a loser. I thought
about killing myself a while back. But soon realized that suicide is not the way out. Because, to my
knowledge, life is the only environment that I am familiar with. Now that suicide is out of the way
and I am not dying anytime soon, I must charge all the way up. If I can't change the changables, I am
inevitably going to feel worse.

	\item Only source of entertainment are books, exercise and sleep.
	\item No one is ever going to do things for me.

\noindent Make the TODO, do the work, as simple as that. Don't blow it now, there is no time.
