    \section{Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning}
    \subsection{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning}

    \noindent Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning (ML),
    which, in turn, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Two of the
    AI breakthroughs as,
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Image classification
	\item Machine translation
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Retrieving and cleaning data}
    \noindent In Python, CSV files can be read by the following command,

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    import pandas as pd
    filepath = `data/irish_data.csv'

    # import the data
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath)

    # print a few rows
    print(data.iloc[:5])
    \end{lstlisting}

    \vspace{1cm}

    \noindent Reading CSV files: useful arguments
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    # for tab-separated file (.tsv)
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath, sep='\t')

    # space-separated file
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath, delim_whitespace=True)

    # don't use the first row for column names:
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None)

    # specify column names
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath, names=['Name1', 'Name2'])

    # custom missing values
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath, na_values=['NA', 99])
    \end{lstlisting}

    \vspace{1cm}

    \noindent Reading and writing JSON files,
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    # read JSON file as dataframe
    data = pd.read_json(filepath)

    # write dataframe file to JSON
    data = pd.to_json(`outputfile.json')
    \end{lstlisting}

    \vspace{1cm}

    \noindent Reading SQL data,
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    import sqlite3 as sq3
    import pandas as pd

    # path to SQLite database
    path = `data/classic_rock.db'

    # create connection to SQL database
    con = sq3.Connection(path)

    # write query
    query = ''' SELECT * FROM rock_songs; '''

    # execute query
    data = pd.read_sql(query, con)
    \end{lstlisting}

    \vspace{1cm}

    \noindent The function read\_sql takes in a query to execute, and a
    connection through which it should execute. As long as these two
    are available, it can execute any query through any connection.

    \pagebreak

    \noindent NoSQL databases,
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Document databases: mongoDB, couchDB
	\item Key-value stores: Riak, Voldemort, Redis
	\item Graph databases: Neo4j, HyperGraph
	\item Wide-column stores: Cassandra, HBase
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent Reading NoSQL data,
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    from pymongo import MongoClient

    # create a mongo connection
    con = MongoClient('path/to/or/url/of/mongo/library')

    # choose database (con.list_database_names() will display available
    # databases)
    db = con.database_name

    # create a curson object using a query
    curson = db.collection_name.find(query)

    # expand cursor and construct DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(list(cursor))
    \end{lstlisting}
    
\end{document}
